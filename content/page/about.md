I am an economics and data science professional with interests in applying statistical and ML approaches to strategic problems. I am Canadian but currently based in Singapore where I work as a lead economist at Grab, South-East Asia's largest tech company. 

I try to support [open-source projects](https://github.com/dshkol) and open data where possible. I'm the co-creator of the [cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html) and [cansim](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) packages. Many of the posts on this page that relate to Canadian data use one or both of these packages, which I likely to shamelessly promote. I also made the [airportr package](https://github.com/dshkol/airportr). 

This entire website was constructed in Rmarkdown using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and Hugo. 

If you wish to get in touch with me or work with me, please use any of links at the top of this page to find me on social media or just to email me directly.
