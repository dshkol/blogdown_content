## Dmitry Shkolnik

I am a data scientist/economist most recently at [Destination Canada](https://www.destinationcanada.com/en) where I specialized in analysis, modelling, and forecasting to better understand the behaviour of international visitors to Canada. I try to support [open-source](https://github.com/dshkol) and open data where possible. I enjoy learning and using new tools whenever the opportunity presents itself, but I work primarily in R. This entire website was constructed in Rmarkdown using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and Hugo. 

I'm am one of the authors of the [cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html) and [cansim](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) packages, creator of the [airportr package](https://github.com/dshkol/airportr), and a contributor to a few other R packages and [projects](https://twitter.com/EveryCityCanada). 

If you wish to get in touch with me or work with me, please use any of links at the top of this page to find me on social media or just to email me directly. Or find me outdoors somewhere in BC. 

Vancouver, BC, Canada
